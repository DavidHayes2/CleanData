And carries out the following processing:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with
the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Files Delivered

+ R script called **run_analysis.R** that deliveres steps 1 to 5 above

+ **README.md* - this file, explaining how the run_analysis.R works

+ a *tidy data set* (in Coursera repository)

+ a CodeBook called **CodeBook.md*  that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations.
